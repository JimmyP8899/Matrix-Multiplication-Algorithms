# Matrix-Multiplication-Algorithms

This Java application implements three different algorithms for matrix multiplication: classic, naive divide-and-conquer, and Strassen's algorithm. The user can choose which algorithm to use and the program will display the results of the multiplication, as well as the time it took for each algorithm to complete.

## Algorithms

Classic matrix multiplication: The standard algorithm for multiplying two matrices using nested loops.
Naive divide-and-conquer: A recursive algorithm that divides the matrices into smaller submatrices and multiplies them in a divide-and-conquer fashion.
Strassen's algorithm: A faster algorithm for matrix multiplication that uses a divide-and-conquer approach and relies on clever matrix manipulation to reduce the number of multiplications required.

## Timer

The program includes a timer that keeps track of the time it takes for each algorithm to complete the matrix multiplication. The user can compare the speed of each algorithm and see which one is the most efficient.

Input

## Input

The program takes two matrices as input and multiplies them using the selected algorithm. The matrices must be square matrices of the same size.
